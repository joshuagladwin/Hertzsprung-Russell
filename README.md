<h1>Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram</h1>

>"The Hertzsprung–Russell diagram, abbreviated as H–R diagram, HR diagram or HRD, 
>is a scatter plot of stars showing the relationship between the stars' absolute magnitudes
>or luminosities versus their stellar classifications or effective temperatures.
>More simply, it plots each star on a graph plotting the star's brightness against its temperature (color)."</i>

The H-R diagram is plotted using the [Hipparcos Catalogue](http://sci.esa.int/hipparcos/) of 118,218 stars and their measurements.
